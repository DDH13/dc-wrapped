This is the repo for the DC Wrapped backend.
We use a Postgres database hosted on Neon.

## Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add necessary environment variables for the database connection.
4. Run `vercel dev` to start the development server. (This will simulate running on vercel locally.)
